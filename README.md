# dharma
Dharma is an 8tracks GUI player based on Orochi

This is not even an alpha. Even basic functionality might or might not work right now.
This repository is only for hosting the code for contributors and those who are interested. Not for daily usage.

I am using Python 2 and GTK3. The UI is partly generated by glade, partly generated programatically.

## TODO
- well first of all, basic functionality of course. play, pause, next track
- I hope I can make it async somehow. No idea how, yet
- pages for the search results. currently only first page is displayed
- at some point in the future I want to implement GNOME's media button handler, but my lowest priority at the moment
